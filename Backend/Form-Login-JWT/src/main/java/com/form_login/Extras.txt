In SecurityConfig class ->
* within securityFilterchain start by adding exception in this way we able to return custom message when
security issue occures

* adding jwt filter before any authentication of spring security
* disabling csrf
* telling spring that we want stateless in this way we can get seesion which don't store cookies
* specifying the endpoints for which authentication is not recquired and for the rest it should be authenticated

In UserException Handler class ->


/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

* Adding Authentication to the securityContext allows me to add @AuthenticationPrincipal annotation as input parameter
at any controller this annotation will inject the authenticated user . so filter will give to the controller an object
of the authenticated user
